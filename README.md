# Welcome!

I am an experienced full stack engineer who specializes in Python, TypeScript, React, Django, Express, and Node. 

## My Story

I went to Oklahoma State University and graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2016. I focused on and enjoyed mechanical vibrations, corrosion, and system dynamics. After graduating, I worked in the field as a lead mechanical engineer and project manager (industrial robotics). On the side, I was taking courses (CS50, Java Foundations, etc) and building my own apps in hopes that I could code full time. 

I switched careers in 2020, and started working at Zumper (San Francisco Real Estate company, < 30 engineers). I worked for them for 3 years, until their latest RIF. 

Now on the hunt for my next adventure 🏹
